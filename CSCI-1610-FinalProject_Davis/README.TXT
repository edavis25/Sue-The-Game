PROJECT TITLE: Sue: The Game!

PURPOSE OF PROJECT: Learning and Fun!

VERSION or DATE: 1.1 - 12/16/2015

HOW TO START THIS PROJECT: Open it with Greenfoot and enjoy!

AUTHORS: Eric Davis

USER INSTRUCTIONS: 

Sue is our hero. She is trying to collect as many bones as she can before getting caught by the
evil dog catcher. Use directional arrows to move around the world and collect bones while avoiding
the dog catcher. 

Eating a yellow bone allows Sue the ability to pee on any hydrant by pressing "space", which momentarily 
distracts the dog catcher. If Sue has the ability to pee, a yellow dot will be on the scoreboard.

When the "pocket" reaches max amount, Sue will flash brown meaning she has the ability to
poop by pressing "p". Pooping creates a trap similar to peeing on a hydrant, but will not distract the dog catcher,
can be placed anywhere, and costs 5 bones from the "pocket". 

Bones in the "pocket" will not be added to the score until they are placed in the doghouse. To remove bones from pocket
and place into the doghouse, HOLD the "space" bar while touching the doghouse.

Once Sue has reached a total "score" of 5, she must watch out for evil squirrels trying to steal her bones. These
squirrels will appear in a bush, run to the doghouse, steal Sue's bones and then return to their bush. Stop them!


HINTS:

Sue moves a little faster when moving diagonally. 

Set traps for the Dog Catcher by pooping or peeing on a hydrant so you have time to deposit bones into the doghouse.
