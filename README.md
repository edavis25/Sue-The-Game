# Sue: The Game!
Programmed by: Eric Davis

Silly little game where Sue (the dog) runs around doing dog things.

"Sue - The Game 1.1.jar" file can be downloaded and then run as a standalone.


##### DESCRIPTION #####

Help Sue collect bones and store them in her doghouse before the dog catcher takes her to the pound!
Yellow bones allow Sue to pee on a fire hydrant to temporarily distract the dog catcher. When Sue's
belly is full, she will flash brown and be able to lay landmines. Watch out for pesky squirrels who
come from the trees to try and steal the bones in the doghouse. Catch them to get your hard-earned 
bones back! God speed.

Sue's secret moves include:

--> Eating bones and depositing them into doghouse. 
    (move with "arrows" and hold "space" on doghouse with bones in inventory to add to score)

--> Peeing on fire hydrants
    (press "space" on a hydrant after eating a yellow bone to distract dog catcher)

--> Pooping
    (press "p" when Sue is flashing brown (inventory is full) to poop. Costs bones from inventory.)

--> Catching squirrels
    (if a squirrel steals your bones, stop them before they get back to their tree to get them back.)
    (squirrels only appear after a certain score has been reached.)
