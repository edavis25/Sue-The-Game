PROJECT TITLE: Sue: The Game!
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: Learning and Fun!
VERSION or DATE: 1.1 - 12/15/2015
HOW TO START THIS PROJECT: Open it with Greenfoot and enjoy!
AUTHORS: Eric Davis
USER INSTRUCTIONS: Sue is our hero. She is trying to collect as many bones as she can before getting caught
by the evil dog catcher. Use directional arrows to move around the world and collect bones while avoiding the
dog catcher. Eating a yellow bone allows Sue the ability to pee on a hydrant by pressing "space", which momentarily 
distracts the dog catcher. When the pocket reaches max amount, Sue will flash brown meaning she has the ability to
poop by pressing "p". Pooping creates a trap similar to peeing on a hydrant, but will not distract the dog catcher,
can be placed anywhere, and removes 5 bones from the "pocket". Bones in the "pocket" will not be added to the
score until they are placed in the doghouse. To remove bones from pocket and place into the doghouse, hold the
"space" bar while touching the doghouse.
